##### Aim
- Exploring CRUD operations
- Dom manipulation 
- Getting and setting items in local storage 

##### Technologies

Materialise 
Vanilla JavaSCript
HTML5
CSS


## Challenges 
I really wanted to play around with local storage in this project, which I really enjoyed familiairising myself with. After storing tracked items, rendering to the UI was a challange. I had initially created html elements entirely in Javascript was challenging as the date and time values were rendered in a seperate footer feature I appended seperately to the list items.

## Key Learnings
This was an exercise to further explore simple JavaScript features, including local storage. 

## Future features
- I would like to refactor in React and apply a backend for user login authentication 
- Explore more responsive design
